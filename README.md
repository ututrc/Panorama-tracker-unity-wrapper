# Panorama-tracker-unity-wrapper
The C# wrapper for Panorama Tracker in Unity3D. For use, add the built plugins to the Assets/Plugins folder, and add the PtWrapper script to the scene to use the PanoramaTracker in Unity3D. After the panorama tracker plugin are placed in their correct folders (Assets/Plugins for .dll, and Assets/Plugins/Android for .so), the tracker can be used through the PtWrapper C# class. The most important functions are InitializeTracking(Color32[] image, int imageWidth, int imageHeight), which begins the tracking. Track(Color32[] image), which should be called in some Update() -loop inside Unity, or whenever a new camera image is acquired. The Color32[] image from the webcamera can be obtained, for example, from Unity3D's WebCamTexture.GetPixels32() function (https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/WebCamTexture.GetPixels32.html).
